# Bhojan-Bazaar-Tasty-Treats-Made-Simple

## Note:

This Project first used the Swiggy API to fetch data. But now it uses a custom server to serve data due to some issues with API as Swiggy's API is not public. Due to which many features had to be removed and some new features have been added.

## Description 📝

Bhojan Bazaar is a ReactJS project that serves as a food ordering app. It uses a custom server to serve data to the client app. It uses React Router Dom for routing and Tailwind CSS for styling. It uses custom hooks for fetching data and shimmer UI made from scratch. It also uses lazy loading and code splitting for better performance.
